# Touchless-Hand-Sanitizer
The Main objective of this system is to dispense a controlled amount of alcohol from a hand sanitizer without touching the bottle. Here we are proposing a system that helps us to clean our hands without touching it. This makes the environment clean. If we touch the bottle to clean then there will be a possibility of spreading the diseases or germs.
